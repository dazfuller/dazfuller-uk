## :wave: Hello

Hi and thank you for visiting my site. This is just a little place where you can learn more about me and the things I get up to.

_I guess I should put this here, but I hate pictures of me, so lets see how long it stays here_

## :child: Where did I start from?

I'm a developer with over 20 years (I do know the actual number, but I don't want to admit it) of experience. But I started way before my first job when I used to help out at the school, looking after their computers and helping to keep them running. This was the era of the legendary classic the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro "BBC Micro") and the [Acorn Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes "Archimedes"). Quite honestly these were peak computers and everything has been downhill since :wink:.

I kept doing this as I moved between schools, and on my first home computer which was the [Amiga A500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500 "Amiga") (okay, that might have been peak computer). Between all of these I'd been programming in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") and getting on pretty happily. In one of my A-Level mathematics pieces I ended up moving from pencil and paper, to programming the scientific calculator I had, and eventually wrote the code to test out the hypothesis using [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic, "BASIC") on a PC. I ended up presenting my course work as reems of code and results and think I confused the teachers enough that they gave me a grade probably higher than I deserved.

When I eventually left school I worked my way from a junior helpdesk role, into a junior developer and junior network engineer role and kind of kept doing that until I ended up where I am now, heading up teams of developers and writing cool software every day. 12 year old me would be proud. At least of the job, probably less proud of the haggered look :upside_down_face:.

## :couple: Personal life

I'm married to my amazing partner Amy and live with my 2 kids, cat, and dog just outside of the Derbyshire Peak District. It's nice being somewhere where there are great walks and incredible scenery just a short distance away.

## Not made with AI

Whilst you might see content on this site describing the work I'm doing with Generative AI what you won't see is any content created using it.

Why? Well, enshittification being a big one. Models are being trained on their own output which is just making the AI slop out there on the web even worse. There's already too much content which is just ChatGPT copy-and-paste and it is truly awful stuff. I don't want to add to the slop.

Also, content creators deserve recognition and reward for their effort. Whilst I'm not after any kind of monetary contribution for my content here, I don't want to see people getting regurgitations of it from bots and then claiming it as their own. For Authors, Musicians, Artists, and other creative arts it's worse. Their content is being used to train these models which then shamelessly re-produce it. Whilst it might seem fun to be able to create something that looks like it came from your favourite artist, it's taken something away from them, be it recognition, trust, or money. Authors, for instance, don't become writers for the money, it's fucking hard to make a living as an author unless you're lucky enough to end up with a franchise through one of your books, but I mean _really_ lucky. Taking from them is literally taking food from their mouths.

So, no part of this site is AI generated. Anything I write here is based on my own work, research, and efforts. I will attribute back to others where their work has been used to build my own. And I will continue to support my favourite artists outside of this site.
