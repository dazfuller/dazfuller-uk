## :wave: Hello

Hi and thank you for visiting my site. This is just a little place where you can learn more about me and the things I get up to.

_I guess I should put this here, but I hate pictures of me, so lets see how long it stays here_

## :child: Where did I start from?

I'm a developer with over 20 years (I do know the actual number, but I don't want to admit it) of experience. But I started way before my first job when I used to help out at the school, looking after their computers and helping to keep them running. This was the era of the legendary classic the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro "BBC Micro") and the [Acorn Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes "Archimedes"). Quite honestly these were peak computers and everything has been downhill since :wink:.

I kept doing this as I moved between schools, and on my first home computer which was the [Amiga A500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500 "Amiga") (okay, that might have been peak computer). Between all of these I'd been programming in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") and getting on pretty happily. In one of my A-Level mathematics pieces I ended up moving from pencil and paper, to programming the scientific calculator I had, and eventually wrote the code to test out the hypothesis using [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic, "BASIC") on a PC. I ended up presenting my course work as reems of code and results and think I confused the teachers enough that they gave me a grade probably higher than I deserved.

When I eventually left school I worked my way from a junior helpdesk role, into a junior developer and junior network engineer role and kind of kept doing that until I ended up where I am now, heading up teams of developers and writing cool software every day. 12 year old me would be proud. At least of the job, probably less proud of the haggered look :upside_down_face:.

## :couple: Personal life

I'm married to my amazing partner Amy and live with my 2 kids, cat, and dog just outside of the Derbyshire Peak District. It's nice being somewhere where there are great walks and incredible scenery just a short distance away.
