## Introduction

As is customary when creating a new site, here's my "first post" entry.

This is something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time but other things kept getting in the way (read, I got distracted by other shiny things). But, I'm here now and so here we go.

The site at the time of writing is still under construction, mostly because I'm working out what I want to put on here, and I'm learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") which is the framework I've used to build this.

Anyway, more content to come soon :grinning:
